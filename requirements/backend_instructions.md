# Backend Instructions (Optional for Basic UI): Tealium MCP Configuration

This guide provides **optional** backend setup instructions using Supabase. For the *basic* Tealium MCP Configuration UI described in `frontend_instructions.md`, a backend is **not strictly required**.  The frontend can directly send data to Tealium.

**Purpose of Backend (Optional - For Future Enhancement):**

A backend like Supabase can become useful for:

*   **Storing Configurations Persistently:** Save Tealium account, profile, and other configurations so users don't have to re-enter them each time.
*   **User Management and Authentication:** Control access to configuration settings.
*   **More Complex Logic:** Implement server-side data transformation, enrichment, or more advanced Tealium API interactions.
*   **Centralized Configuration Management:** Manage configurations for multiple Tealium integrations in one place.

**For the initial "few steps" UI, you can skip these backend instructions and directly use the frontend component in `frontend_instructions.md`.**

**However, if you want to set up a Supabase backend for future enhancements, follow these steps:**

## Setup Steps (Optional Supabase Backend)

If you choose to use Supabase:

- [x] **Create a Supabase Project:**
    1.  Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up or log in.
    2.  Create a new Supabase project. Choose a database password and region.
    3.  Once your project is created, go to "Project Settings" -> "Database" and find your **Database connection string**. You'll need this later.

- [x] **Install Supabase JavaScript Client Library:**

    In your project's frontend directory (or root if you're creating a full-stack app):

    ```bash
    npm install @supabase/supabase-js
    # or
    yarn add @supabase/supabase-js
    ```

- [x] **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in your project's root and add your Supabase project URL and API key (anon key):

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL  # From Supabase project settings
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY # From Supabase project settings -> API
    ```
    **Important:** Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that are accessed in the browser (frontend).

- [ ] **(Future Enhancement) Create a Configuration Table in Supabase:**

    If you want to store configurations in Supabase, you would create a database table (e.g., "tealium_configurations") to store settings like Tealium account, profile, etc. You can use the Supabase UI to create tables.

- [ ] **(Future Enhancement) Create API Routes or Server Actions (Next.js) to interact with Supabase:**

    You would then create Next.js API routes or Server Actions to:
    1.  **Fetch configurations** from Supabase.
    2.  **Save configurations** to Supabase (from the UI).
    3.  **Potentially implement backend logic** related to Tealium integration.

**Example: (Conceptual - Saving configuration to Supabase via a Server Action)**

```typescript
// actions/config-actions.ts (Conceptual - not fully implemented)
'use server';

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

export async function saveTealiumConfig(formData: FormData) {
  const account = formData.get('tealiumAccount') as string;
  const profile = formData.get('tealiumProfile') as string;
  // ... get other config values from formData

  try {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('tealium_configurations')
      .upsert({ account, profile, /* ... other config values */ }, { onConflict: ['account'] }); // Example: upsert based on account

    if (error) {
      console.error("Supabase error saving config:", error);
      return { status: 'error', message: 'Failed to save configuration to Supabase.' };
    }

    revalidatePath('/tealium-config'); // Revalidate the config page if needed
    return { status: 'success', message: 'Configuration saved successfully!' };

  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving config:", error);
    return { status: 'error', message: 'Error saving configuration.' };
  }
}



Recommendations (Backend - if Implemented)
Security:

Secure API Routes: If you create API routes or server actions for handling configurations, ensure they are secure. Implement authentication if needed to control who can access and modify configurations.

Database Security: Follow Supabase best practices for database security, including secure database passwords and appropriate access roles.

Environment Variable Security: Protect your Supabase project URL and API keys. Do not commit .env.local files to version control in production environments. Use secure environment variable management in your deployment platform.

Data Validation (Backend): Implement server-side validation for any data received from the frontend before saving it to the database. This adds an extra layer of data quality assurance.

Error Logging and Monitoring: Implement proper error logging on the backend. If you are using server actions or API routes, log errors and monitor your backend for issues. Supabase provides some built-in monitoring, but consider adding more detailed logging if needed.

Scalability: If you anticipate storing a large number of configurations or handling frequent requests, consider scalability aspects of your Supabase setup. Supabase offers different database instance sizes and scaling options.

Alternative Backend Options: While Supabase is a great option, depending on your project's needs, you could also consider other backend options like:

Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions): For simpler backend logic without managing a full server.

Node.js Backend with Express or NestJS: For more complex backend requirements.

Other Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers.

Choose the backend technology that best aligns with your team's skills and project requirements.

API Key Management (If storing API Keys): If in the future, you need to handle Tealium API keys or other sensitive credentials, store them securely on the backend (e.g., using environment variables in a secure server environment, or using a secrets management service) and avoid exposing them to the frontend or storing them directly in the database in plain text.

These backend recommendations are relevant if you decide to extend the basic UI with a backend component for persistent configuration storage, user management, or more advanced server-side logic. For the initial UI setup and testing, a backend is optional.
